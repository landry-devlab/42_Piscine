42 Piscine repo: Shell and C exercises focusing on C fundamentals, algorithms, memory, and modular programming from the 4-week bootcamp selection.

## Overview

This Piscine aims to strengthen skills in C programming and command-line usage. Work is done individually, following a progressive, hands-on approach: each subject focuses on mastering specific concepts.

The project focuses on reimplementing and practicing C and shell fundamentals, from basic commands to advanced data structures.

* Subject: subjects available in August 2025
* Validation date: **August 2025** - 42 Vienna

---

## Purpose and Scope

The objective of this school selection is to develop a solid foundation in C programming and shell usage, preparing students for more complex projects later on.

The scope includes:

* Mastery of shell commands and scripting
* Understanding of pointers, memory management, and structs in C
* Implementation of linked lists, string manipulation, and algorithmic problem solving
* Strict adherence to 42 coding standards and project constraints

---

## Coding Standard and Constraints

This project strictly adheres to the **42 Norm**, which enforces consistency, readability, and maintainability.

Key constraints include:

* Compliance with the official 42 Norm
* No usage of forbidden standard library functions
* Maximum of 25 lines per function
* One instruction per line
* Mandatory file headers
* Consistent indentation and naming conventions
* No memory leaks or undefined behavior

All sources are compiled with the following flags:

```bash
-Wall -Wextra -Werror

```
Any deviation from these rules results in non-compliance.

## Files Content
Files are grouped by subject and type. Each file focuses on a specific skill:

### Shell:

shell00 – basic shell commands and navigation

shell01 – file management and permissions


### C Programming:

C00 – basic functions, conditionals, and loops

C01 – functions and function prototypes

C02 – pointers, arrays, and strings

C03 – memory allocation and management

C04 – structures and typedef

C05 – advanced string manipulation

C06 – linked lists (t_list) basics

C07 – recursive algorithms

C08 – function pointers and modularity

C09 – comprehensive exercises integrating previous skills

---

## Testing Strategy

When necessary, each function includes its own dedicated test file.

### Testing procedure:

Open the corresponding test file

Uncomment the test section by removing /* */

Compile manually as instructed

This approach allows isolated validation and precise debugging of individual components.

### Checking Tools
The project was checked using the following tools:

* **Minimoulinette**
  [https://github.com/42school/norminette](https://github.com/k11q/mini-moulinette)

* **Norminette**
  [https://github.com/42school/norminette](https://github.com/42school/norminette)


### References and Resources
Primary references used during development:

Linux manual pages (man 3 <function>)

C Programming: A Modern Approach, K. N. King

Peer reviews and collaborative debugging sessions

These resources ensure correctness, expected behavior, and conformity with standard C specifications.
