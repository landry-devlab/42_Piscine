# C02 - Piscine

## Overview

C02 focuses on string manipulation in C. Students will practice copying strings, checking character types, converting case, and handling memory safely. Exercises gradually introduce more complex string operations, preparing students for real-world C programming tasks.

## Objectives

* Practice copying strings safely and efficiently
* Learn to check character types (alpha, numeric, printable, lowercase, uppercase)
* Convert strings to uppercase, lowercase, and capitalize words
* Understand string length limitations with `strlcpy`
* Handle non-printable characters
* Reinforce coding discipline according to the 42 Norm

---

## Testing and Validation

* Each exercise can be tested manually by compiling and running the functions
* Ensure outputs match expected results for all test cases
* Verify proper memory handling and string operations
