# C03 - Piscine

## Overview

C03 focuses on advanced string manipulation in C. Students will practice comparing strings, concatenating them, and searching for substrings. These exercises develop a deeper understanding of string handling and memory considerations.

## Objectives

* Compare strings using `strcmp` and `strncmp`
* Concatenate strings with `strcat` and `strncat`
* Search for substrings using `strstr`
* Use `strlcat` safely for string concatenation
* Reinforce proper handling of string lengths and memory
* Follow 42 Norm coding standards

---

## Testing and Validation

* Compile and run each function to validate outputs
* Test all edge cases (empty strings, partial matches, maximum lengths)
* Ensure proper memory safety and behavior according to the 42 Norm
