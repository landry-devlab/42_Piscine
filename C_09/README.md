# C09 - Piscine

## Overview

C09 focuses on building a static library and organizing a C project at a higher level. Students will learn how to compile multiple source files, create libraries, use Makefiles, and implement more complex utility functions.

Be carreful : ex02 is missing to fill the requirement to pass the module
